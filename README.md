# Change Calculator

This is a small beginner project I made while learning JavaScript. It's a simple change calculator that shows how much change you should get back in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What It Does

You enter the amount due and the amount received, then click the calculate button. The app breaks down the change into the right number of bills and coins.

### Why I Made It

This was part of my learning for JavaScript. I wanted to practice things like:

* Selecting elements from the page
* Listening for user actions (like clicking a button)
* Doing calculations and rounding with JavaScript
* Updating the DOM with results dynamically

### How to Use It

1. Open the site in your browser (or open `index.html` from the project files).
2. Type in the amount due.
3. Type in the amount received.
4. Click the **Calculate** button.
5. See the amount of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies you should get back.

### What I Learned

* How to work with event listeners and inputs
* Manipulating the DOM to show results
* Handling user input validation
* Using basic math and rounding for currency
